The most lavish thing is the castle.
↳ Oona-Lynn owns the manor.
↳ Has a horse & carriage.
We are the more talented fighters in the city. not exactly city guard, but enough to be level 1.
There is a militia funded by the duke.
A normal day passes, we received an invite to dinner@ the castle, in a few days time..
↳ Congrats for keeping town safe.
↳ We hear rumors the Duke has found a duchess.
We prep for travel.
Take note
