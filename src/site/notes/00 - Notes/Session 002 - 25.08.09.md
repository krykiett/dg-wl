#### Recap
We had our evening at the wedding. A slight display of magic power from the duke, when detering the werewolf. We were given a message to GTFO. On exit, we were confronted for not saying bye. Because it’s rude not to say goodbye. Upon arrival back in the town, a local lumberjack had gone missing a few nights, before.

When we went back down the mountain there was no sign of the tree that blocked our path. NO signs whatsoever.

#### Session
We are gathered inside the Tippy Tankerd, the local watering hole. 

Korrin - He is a dao. A stone genie. Looks orish, but isn’t. Burley man, stone like dreadlocks, a bit of tusks, dirty white tank top, messy apron. Old man at the bar shooting the shit, crackling fire in the fireplace. Curled in front of the fireplace is an orange tabby cat. No other patrons, kinda late, like 11pm. We just arrived about an hour or so ago, were told by the watchmen who keeps an eye on the road, that a lumberjack has gone missing.

Olfric - Lumberjack, bugbear. Gone missing. The wood just west of the city. Went to lunch break and when they went to gather his collectings, they found his axe in a stump. No wife, no kids, single and older. 

We make out way through the town to the location Olfric went missing, we can see the castle in the distance. Crack of lightening looms. 

From all the windows of the castle, we see a bright green flash, like someone took a picture a few seconds after the lightening. A few moments later, a cooling chill cuts the air. On the wind we hear like a whisper. The wind came from the mountains. 

As we walk, we do hear the faint hoots of owls and whatnot, nothing really out of sort. About 45 minutes into the walk, a cold dewy mist begins to hang in the air. We are in a low part of the mountains. Creeping mist curling around our ankles. 

We approach the logging site. We see a thousand trees felled and cleared. Remnants here and there. There are logging tools in a small pavilion, a lantern, hanging lit from it. We can hear someone working removing bark from a tree.

This large creature grabs the lantern and calls out us. PLOT TWIST: It’s Olfric.

He got down with work early, took a nap, work up in the dark. 

He leads us into a hut and to a square shaped box cover with a cloth. Inside it looks like a small bird, but with 4 legs and long tail. To legs are paws. He woke up with an egg and it hatched into this. He believes it’s a gryphon. He goes and gets it food. It’s a “monster” but it’s a baby, he says.

We discuss what to do with this gryphon.

He is going to keep and raise it. The cold breeze blew out his lantern, which is weird because it’s shielded. 

Olfric mentions an orb from his grandfather. He gives it to us for our silence about the gryphon. Lazlo tools it to Theo and he begins to mess with it. 

The orb: Infernal Box of : Divination seals with divine. Two magical schools but the second is being overwhelmed by the Divine. There are different ways to twist it and there are symbols but they are alien in nature. 

He gives Theo 1,000gp to get a tracking collar crafted, if we make it to the capital city. 

He takes us to the spot the egg fell on him.

Sasha and Shamoa don’t see any signs of anything, really. The grass isn’t even pressed down any longer. They hear the snapping of a branch. They hear the flapping of wings and sounds of a crow as it flew off. 

Shamoa faintly smells rain. Like it’s going to start raining. Theo feels a rain drop on his nose. Olfric will let us stay at his house until the storm passes. Thunder rumbling, Olfric gets us comfortable. 

We sleep. 

Oona dreams of us traveling, it’s a pleasant dream. She lays down in the back of the wagon, crack of thunder, eyes pop open, the horse neighs and she awakens. “We’re being attacked!” bandits are attacking. Sasha slits everyone’s throats and they all fall dead. Her dreams fades. Sasha eats the dream.

It’s still raining, but it’s no longer a heavy thunderstorm. 

We head back to the town. Olfric walks with us until we get to the logging site. 

We make it back to town and even in the rain, everyone is still getting the city square ready for the harvest festival. Decorations are being put up, fragile things are still tucked away until the weather clears. We see, the party organizer (mayor) standing around with a journal and he is checking and things off and giving orders. We pass the square, we see in the overcast morning another flash of lightening above the castle. The same green light shoot from the castle into the sky, large green pulse covers the area and the rain stops. 

In a few minutes, a pulse of wind and we hear almost like a screech before it cuts off. The patrons stop for a moment, then just go back to doing what they were doing.

Shamoa sees a normal human townie, his face half covered in old burn scars, pushing a wheelbarrow of supplies. He doesn’t recognize him.

The overcast disperses. 

Shamoa approaches the burn man we’ve never seen before. He got drunk and fell into a fire. Oona can tell he is lying. 

There are two large crates of silver. Various objects: Silverware, daggers, etc.

Shamoa gives chase. Theo is on him, but they are unable to find him. A block away we hear a woman scream. A bunch of shouting. On the main road, we see this man trying to run out. He is outrunning us, but Shamoa can see there are tracks. 

Shamoa and Theo stealth into the forrest after him as Martock waits for the party.

We hear a twig snap behind us, “Why are you following me? Who are you?”

He tried to steal from the wedding and got burned up. He is a drifter and he has no home. 

We engage in combat and end him. Shamoa grabs the body by a leg and pulls him back to town. Theo can see, as Shamoa lifts the body on the cart, lets out some steam. We make our way back to the town and the drifter’s dead body weight cause one of the wheels to snap.

Shamoa casts mending on the wheel. We gather the townsfolk and distribute their items that were stolen. A community potluck is prepared and there is a field stew. 

WE LEVEL and get short rest. The chancellor gives the party 100gp as a reward to the party for all of this.

A few more hours pass after lunch, some of us are helping clean up. 

Something is coming into town. It’s similar to a wind/dust cloud. Once it gets at 50’ it comes to a halt and someone gets off this large, bird like creature. He grabs the reins and pulls it in. We see a blue skinned man, with long white cloudy colored hair. Wearing leather traveling attire, large satchel bag. The bird is huge, bright orange almost ostrich with a beak like an axe. It is an alpha/apex axe beak. He approaches the group. “Looking for a group of heroes that reside here”.

He is an air genasai. He has a letter for us from the capital. Seems important. It’s from the governor. Word about what we’ve been doing here has gotten to the capital.

The bird is Betty. She’s part of the royal mail service. Royal is “the brand”.

His name is Otto. 

Lazlo opens the envelope. There are 4 large envelops inside, like large file folders. There is a small one with a letter:

“Hello, intrepid hero’s, I am aware of your deeds, in the small town of Ishka, I am requesting your aid to clean up the road of bandits. There are for our detailed lists of everything stolen. Each are inventories from local business and workshops. Upon the completion of retrieval you’ll receive 5,000gp.

Theo’s list is is items taken from a magic item shop. Nothing seems super powerful, but magic is magic.
A general supply store.
A doctors office.
Weirdly enough, the library (Languages, translation books).

We rest for the night and depart for the capital at first light. 

Shattering glass as something comes busting through the window…. It awakens us all (did we get a long rest? Yes.)
